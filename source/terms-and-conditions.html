          <h2>CHALLENGE PARTICIPATION</h2>
          <p>Entrants must submit their entries to the Challenge through the challenge website and follow the steps indicated. Entrants need to use the 360Giving dataset in their work. To access the data, select one of the methods below:</p>
          <p>Query and download data from the GrantNav platform: <a href="http://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/" target="_blank">http://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/</a></p>
          <p>Query data from our redash <a href="https://app.redash.io/360giving/" target="_blank">https://app.redash.io/360giving/</a></p>
          <p>Download files from the registry: <a href="http://www.threesixtygiving.org/data/data-registry/" target="_blank">http://www.threesixtygiving.org/data/data-registry/</a></p>
          <p>Entries may come from an individual or from a team of up to eight people. If submitting on behalf of a team, the entry should include all the names of the team members, but any awards made will be granted to the owner of the email address used in conjunction with the submission.</p>
          <p>Each submission to the Challenge must be accompanied by a primary contact name (full, legal name) and a primary contact email address (valid email). </p>
          <p>If you should win the Challenge, we will contact you using this primary email address. We are not responsible for incorrectly-entered user information resulting in the inability to contact you.</p>
          <p>Each entrant, either individual or team, can submit up to two data visualizations, one for each question. Any attempt to submit more than two entries will result in disqualification.</p>
          <p>Entries must be received via the online submission form, starting 27th April 2018. Entries will be accepted up to 15th June 2018 at 11:59:59 pm British Summer Time (BST).</p>
          
          <h2>SUBMITTED MATERIALS</h2>
          <p>Entries must be data visualizations. A range of media will be accepted, including - but not limited to - interactive web apps, graphic images, video, etc. Note that if you do create an interactive app (Javascript, Flash, etc.), it must function in a normal web browser environment and you must host it on your own site. We retain the right to judge what is and is not a valid visualization, and to disqualify entries that are not data visualizations.</p>
          <p>Entries must use the 360Giving data set. In order to answer the Challenge questions you must use other datasets as well and we encourage you to do so. You can find a list of suggested datasets <a href="{{ '/resources.html' | relative_url }}">here</a>.</p>
          <p>The entrant is responsible for the cost (if any) of sending any submission to the Challenge Sponsor. </p>
          <p>By submitting an entry you agree explicitly that all components of your submission and supporting information are indeed original creations. Any intellectual property infringement, misuse or plagiarism of another’s work in any form or state will result in immediate disqualification and forfeiture of eligibility to receive all recognition and awards. You also agree to allow 360Giving to make public statements regarding any disqualifications and any grounds for disqualification.</p>
          <p>Depending on the type of media used for your entry, your visualization will either be hosted on our site, on your own site, or on a third party site:</p>
          <p>Stand-alone images will be uploaded and hosted on our site.</p>
          <p>Videos can be uploaded to YouTube or embedded on our site.</p>
          <p>Interactive visualizations must be hosted on your own site. Our site will feature images or screenshots of the project, but you are responsible for keeping an active, working, accessible web page with the visualization. If you are a finalist, we will discuss with you howwe can keep hosting the project after the challenge is over. </p>
