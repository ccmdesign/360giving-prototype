        <li>Aesthetics and creativity</li>
        <li>How innovative it is compared to current visualisations.</li>

      <p>Entries must use the 360Giving dataset to answer one of the Challenge questions and you are encouraged to use other datasets alongside it. You can find a list of suggest datasets here.</p>
