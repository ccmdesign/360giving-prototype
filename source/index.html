      <p>360Giving is inviting businesses, not for profit organisations and individuals to use the 360Giving dataset to develop and visualise innovative solutions to two key questions facing the grantmaking sector.</p>
      <p>Your data visualisations must answer the following questions that were selected by an expert panel in our Quest for Questions Challenge</p>
      <h3>Question 1</h3>
      <p>Who has funded what themes throughout the years?</p>
      <h3>Question 2</h3>
      <p>User-led organisations: Who funds them, in what thematic area, how much funding do they receive and what type of organisation are they (e.g. CIC, charity, co-operative, community group)?</p>

      <p class="highlight">Whether it’s an interactive web app, a graphic image, a video or another form of visualisation, we are looking for responses to these questions that excite and appeal. They will be assessed against the following criteria:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The applicant’s ability to answer the Challenge question correctly and clearly</li>
        <li>Aesthetics and creativity</li>
        <li>How innovative it is compared to current visualisations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Entries must use the 360Giving dataset to answer one of the Challenge questions and you are encouraged to use other datasets alongside it. You can find a list of suggest datasets here.</p>
      <p>All submissions will be judged by a panel made up of experts from the sector selected by 360Giving. They will award prizes of between £2,000 and £6,000 to the best three responses to the questions.</p>
      <p>In addition, each entry that meets our submission criteria will receive an award of between £100 and £500 (depending on the number of submissions and their quality).</p>
