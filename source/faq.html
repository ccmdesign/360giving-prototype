            <h3>How do we define user-led organisations?</h3>
            <p>User-led organisations are organisations that are run by and controlled by people who use support services. You can find user-led organisations in <a href="http://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/" target="_blank">GrantNav</a> by typing ‘user-led’ in the grants description field. If you are using other datasets, we allow a broad understanding of the term, e.g. user-led, community-led, patient-led, youth-led. Please provide a short justification of your chosen groups, explaining how they fall into the user-led category.</p>
